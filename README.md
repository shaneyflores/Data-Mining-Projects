# Data Mining Projects

This repository contains several examples of common data mining algorithms I implemented in Python. Many of the algorithms were built from scratch so I could understand the algorithm in-depth while a few use currently available tools in published Python packages (such as scipy). These projects are meant for purely educational purposes, as well as to showcase the value of studying data mining algorithms. 

Each project contains a Jupyter Notebook, a PDF copy of the notebook, and a HTML render of the Jupyter Notebook. 

## Bagging

This project implements bagging in an ensemble learning classification task. The first part uses a simple bagging procedure while the second implements the more commonly used AdaBoost algorithm. 

## KDE

This project implements several different kernel density estimation approaches to estimate the density of some randomly generated data. 

## KNN

This project implements a K-nearest neighbor regression using different values for K, as well as different approaches for weight estimation.
