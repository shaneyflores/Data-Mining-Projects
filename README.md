# Data Mining Projects

This repository contains several examples of common data mining algorithms I implementd in Python. Many of the algorithms were built from the ground up so I could fully understand the algorithm while a few use currently available tools in published Python packages (such as scipy). 

## Bagging

This project implements bagging in an ensemble learning classification task. The first part uses a simple bagging procedure while the second implements the more commonly used AdaBoost algorithm. 

## KDE

This project implements several different kernel density estimation approaches that estimate the density of some randomly generated data. 

## KNN

This project implements a K-nearest neighbor regression using different values for K, as well as different approaches for weight estimation.
